# Deploy your CDS package in GCP App Engine
This is followed for Windows

## Prerequisite
1. GCP account is active. If no, click here and see details - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free)
2. You have tested your CAPM-NodeJS code Locally. You can run your CDS services - (http://localhost:4004/) and it works fine.

## Deployment Steps
1. Install GCP Cli from the below link - [GoogleCloudSDKInstaller](https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe)

2. Authenticate to Google Cloud by below command. While loading it might open a browser and ask for Authentication to your GCP
```sh
gcloud auth login
```

3. Set your Project for GCP for GCP-Cli
```sh
gcloud config set project tidal-analogy-285516
```

4. Now we need to change the package(my-bookshop) a bit.
    - Create a 'app.yaml' file inside the package my-bookshop
    ```sh
    runtime: nodejs12
    ```
    - Your package will look like -
    ```sh
    my-bookshop/
        app
        db
        srv
        app.yaml
        package.json
        package-lock.json
        myCustAPI.js
        README.md
    ```    

5. Now lets deploy with the below command:
```sh
gcloud app deploy
```

6. Your API is not being hosted in GCP:

## Common Error
This deployment might give you the error as - "Internal server error" Whenever Catalog urls are executed.
- To solve this use the [package.json](https://github.com/sabarna17/sample-capm-gcp-vm/blob/main/deploy-cds-in-gcp/package.json) file
